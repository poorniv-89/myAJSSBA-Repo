This app helps users find recipes from an API. User have to just type in the food or ingredients and the app will show the recipe with ingredients, picture and the necessary steps to cook it. It also gets the feedback from the user and stores it in local.
This is an easy way to get ideas for what to make!

**What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?**
could have researched more on the APIs as I was building this page, my free API requests count was over and couldn't access the API anymore. I had to work on the entire page all over from the scratch.

**What would you add to, or change about your application if given more time?**
will try to bring more than one recipe to be displayed if the user selected an item which has more than 1 recipe.
